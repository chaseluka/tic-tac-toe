Project Overview
========

This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game that allows a two-player game mode or player vs intelligent AI. Banking off the library project preceeding this, the object of this project was to practice object oriented programming, this time not using classes and basic objects, but factory functions. 

The AI of this project was teh biggest task, using the recursive minimax algothrm, I was able to implement the computer to find the best possible move. AI difficulty is also determined by sucess rate (e.g., medium difficulty has 50% best possible move, or else it's a random move).
